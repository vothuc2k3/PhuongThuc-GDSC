                        This is why the "new York Times team" should get fired.
                        
                        On March 23, 2012, Breitbart's "founder" Alex Jones sent out this tweet:
                        
                        So when you think "big government" like it just goes away, you're wrong. We will not be standing around watching our government be corrupted by lobbyists, lobbyists at the State Department, and other government agencies. We will defend our Constitution and Constitutional rights and our First Amendment. I guarantee you that it will protect freedom of expression wherever it may lie or which it may be construed as. — Mr. Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) March 24, 2012
                        
                        The tweet from @RealAlexJones was tweeted at 4:41pm Eastern time on March 23, 2012.
                        
                        The New York Times reported during its 2012 Media Summit keynote on March 23 that the government is now working on new policy and regulations governing media ownership.
                        
                        "It's being run from the Department of Justice, so we're having to make sure it can always be controlled by the president," Breitbart senior writer Jon Gruden told CNBC.
                        
                        "We're getting involved with a few different entities — one in Los Angeles, another in Pittsburgh and so on," he continued.
                        
                        Alex Jones and the Trump Administration have an agenda of controlling media and censorship that could hurt our freedom and keep our country safe. But the Times is working to get rid of this rotten system</p>
